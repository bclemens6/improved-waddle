# improved-waddle
A script that takes your Baseball Savant data and returns various batted ball metrics
You'll need Baseball Savant data for the batted balls you'd like to summarize, modified very slightly to add an identifier that combines batter and season.
The output will be a CSV with MLBAMID, AvgEV, MaxEV, EV95, LASD, and number of batted balls for each batter-season from 2015-2022.
